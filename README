cbuild.sh looks for CMakeLists.txt and executes cmake. Works in build/
directory as well, but it is recommended to run it in a main directory.

Example:

$ ls
CmakeLists.txt test.c
$ cbuild.sh
cbuild.sh: There is a CMakeLists.txt of the project present.
(...)
[100%] Built target test
$

$ cd build/
$ cbuild.sh
cbuild.sh: We are in the build directory, going up.
cbuild.sh: NOTE: you should run this script in the root of the project.
cbuild.sh: There is a CMakeLists.txt of the project present.
(...)
[100%] Built target test
$ cd .
$
